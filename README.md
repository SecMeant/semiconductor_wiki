# Wiki for low cost semiconductor manufacturing research

## How to an create article
1. Create directory with the name of the article (or some short form of it if the name is long)
1. Inside that directory, create a <name>.md file that is the main file of the article written in markdown. The <name> should match the one of a direct parent directory. For example: photolithography/photolithography.md
1. Put all other necessary files needed alongside the article like pictures, videos, references.

## What is an article
It doesn't have to be "the best paper ever published" - trust me, we don't care. We just want to have a place where we can store all of our knownledge about the process for the manufacturing that is easily accessible and searchable.

## Software side of the research
[pico-furnace](https://github.com/SecMeant/pico-furnace) - embedded firmware for raspberry pico W that drives most of our hardware.
