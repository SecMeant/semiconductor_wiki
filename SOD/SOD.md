# Phosphorus based, N-type Spin-On-Dopant

## Synthesis
Follow [fangsuwannarak-2019](./fangsuwannarag2019.pdf).  
Synthesized SOD using that method becomes too "jelly-like" after 24 hours. Because we want to use it for longer, we developed a slight modification to the process, internally called FJH (Fangsuwannarak-Joor-Holz).  
It changes from 10:20:3 TEOS:EtOH:H2O to 7:23:3 and 6:24:3.  
We are still testing the modified SOD solution and not ready to post any long-term recommendation on which one of the modified two is better.
