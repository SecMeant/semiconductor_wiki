# Problem statement
RCA clean requires expensive quartz glassware.
We don't have access (at the time of writing article) to all of the chemicals to synthesize RCA-1 and RCA-2.

# Solution
I propose an alternative to RCA, also consisting of two separate steps.

Clean-1:
1. DI water
1. H2O2
1. H2SO4

Clean-2:
1. DI water
1. H2O2
1. HCl
