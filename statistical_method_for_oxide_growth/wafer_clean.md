# Problem statement
RCA clean requires expensive quartz glassware.
We don't have access (at the time of writing article) to all of the chemicals to synthesize RCA-1 and RCA-2.

# Solution
I propose an alternative to RCA, also consisting of two separate steps.

Clean-1:
1. H2O2 12% + H2SO4 10% (1:1) 3 minutes.
1. DI Water rinse 10 seconds.

Clean-2:
1. H2O2 12% + HCl 35% (1:1) 3 minutes.
1. DI Water rinse 10 seconds.
